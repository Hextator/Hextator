# Hexware

is a collection of community funded software products that I (Hextator) have produced, via reverse engineering and/or researching things that I find interesting.

Commits are usually intended for public use, but some projects may only be shared for their novelty, with myself as the only anticipated user.

Contributions are mostly geared toward sharing details gleaned from reverse engineering video games, and may include source code for making modifications to them.
They are not limited to this, however, and there may be snippets of code or other resources which could aid in general software development.

I live in no-healthcare-land, and I haven't been doing well since...probably 2011, if I'm being honest, so you're basically going to be donating to a charity for disabled abuse victims with no middle men scraping off the top.
